Need to get the event title, event type, and uma name into an object so
I can use it for tool calls. GET THE FUCKING TEXT FROM THE IMAGE PROVIDED!!
DO NOT MAKE SHIT UP!

There are 3 Event Types, Trainee, Scenario, & Support.
Make sure to include punctuation and symbols in the title if it is there.
Keep the original title, do not modify the title name.

You will find the Event Type above the Event Title.
Trainee Events Have Pink Backgrounds.
Support Events Have Blue Backgrounds.
Scenario Events I think have Green Backgrounds.

Events type/title will not have transparent backgrounds.
Must have a Pink, Blue, or Green Background.

"Junior Year Pre-Debut" and Month names are not event titles!

Current Umamusume: "{umamusume}"
